It has equal portions of espresso, whipped milk and milk foam.\nTraditionally, the cappuccino had a cap of milk foam raising above the top of the cup. Nowadays, you will often see the 'latte art' variant of this drink, which follows the same recipe, but with a more gentle pouring technique of the frothed milk.",
